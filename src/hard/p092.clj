;; READ ROMAN NUMERALS

;; Difficulty: Hard
;; Topics: strings math

;; Roman numerals are easy to recognize, but not everyone knows all the rules necessary to work with them. Write a function to parse a Roman-numeral string and return the number it represents.
;; You can assume that the input will be well-formed, in upper-case, and follow the ;; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_numerals#Subtractive_principle;; . You don't need to handle any numbers greater than MMMCMXCIX (3999), the largest number representable with ordinary letters.

;; Test cases (evaluates to true when your solution is correct):
(= 14 (__ "XIV"))
(= 827 (__ "DCCCXXVII"))
