;; LATIN SQUARE SLICING

;; Difficulty: Hard
;; Topics: data-analysis math


;; A http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_square of order n 
;; is an n x n array that contains n different elements, 
;; each occurring exactly once in each row, and exactly once in each column. 
;; For example, among the following arrays only the first one forms a Latin square:
;; A B C    A B C    A B C
;; B C A    B C A    B D A
;; C A B    C A C    C A B
;; Let V be a vector of such vectors1 that they may differ in length2.
;; We will say that an arrangement of vectors of V in consecutive rows 
;; is an alignment (of vectors) of V
;; if the following conditions are satisfied:
;; All vectors of V are used.
;; Each row contains just one vector.
;; The order of V is preserved.
;; All vectors of maximal length are horizontally aligned each other.
;; If a vector is not of maximal length then all its elements are aligned 
;;     with elements of some http://clojuredocs.org/clojure_core/clojure.core/subvec 
;;     of a vector of maximal length.
;; Let ;; L;;  denote a Latin square of order 2 or greater.
;; We will say that ;; L ;; is included;;  in ;; V;;  or 
;; that ;; V ;; includes ;; L
;; iff there exists an alignment of ;; V 
;; such that contains a subsquare that is equal to ;; L;; .
;; For example, if V equals [[1 2 3][2 3 1 2 1][3 1 2]] 
;; then there are nine alignments of V (brackets omitted): 
;;         1              2              3

;;       1 2 3          1 2 3          1 2 3
;;   A   2 3 1 2 1    2 3 1 2 1    2 3 1 2 1
;;       3 1 2        3 1 2        3 1 2

;;       1 2 3          1 2 3          1 2 3
;;   B   2 3 1 2 1    2 3 1 2 1    2 3 1 2 1
;;         3 1 2        3 1 2        3 1 2

;;       1 2 3          1 2 3          1 2 3
;;   C   2 3 1 2 1    2 3 1 2 1    2 3 1 2 1
;;           3 1 2        3 1 2        3 1 2
;; Alignment ;; A1;;  contains Latin square ;; [[1 2 3][2 3 1][3 1 2]];; , 
;; alignments ;; A2, A3, B1, B2, B3;;  contain no Latin squares, and alignments;; C1, C2, C3;;  contain ;; [[2 1][1 2]];; .
;; Thus in this case ;; V;;  includes one Latin square of order 3 
;; and one of order 2 which is included three times.
;; Our aim is to implement a function which accepts a vector of vectors V as an argument, 
;; and returns a map which keys and values are integers. 
;; Each key should be the order of a Latin square included in V, 
;; and its value a count of different Latin squares of that order included in V. 
;; If V does not include any Latin squares an empty map should be returned.
;; In the previous example the correct output of such a function is {3 1, 2 1} and not {3 1, 2 3}.
;; 1 Of course, we can consider sequences instead of vectors. 

;; 2 Length of a vector is the number of elements in the vector.
