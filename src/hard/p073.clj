;; ANALYZE A TIC-TAC-TOE BOARD

;; Difficulty: Hard
;; Topics: game

;; A ;; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tic-tac-toe;;  board is represented by a two dimensional vector. X is represented by :x, O is represented by :o, and empty is represented by :e.  A player wins by placing three Xs or three Os in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.  Write a function which analyzes a tic-tac-toe board and returns :x if X has won, :o if O has won, and nil if neither player has won.
