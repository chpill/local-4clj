;; Difficulty: Easy
;; Topics: seqs math

;; Create a function that computes the ;; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product#Definition;;  of two sequences. You may assume that the vectors will have the same length.

(def __ ;; Your solution here!
  
  ,,,)



;; Test cases (evaluates to true when your solution is correct):
(= 0 (__ [0 1 0] [1 0 0]))
(= 3 (__ [1 1 1] [1 1 1]))
(= 32 (__ [1 2 3] [4 5 6]))
(= 256 (__ [2 5 6] [100 10 1]))
