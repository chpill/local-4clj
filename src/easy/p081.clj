;; Special restrictions:
;; intersection

;; Write a function which returns the intersection of two sets.  The intersection is the sub-set of items that each set has in common.

(def __ ;; Your solution here!

  ,,,)



;; Test cases (evaluates to true when your solution is correct):
(= (__ #{0 1 2 3} #{2 3 4 5}) #{2 3})
(= (__ #{0 1 2} #{3 4 5}) #{})
(= (__ #{:a :b :c :d} #{:c :e :a :f :d}) #{:a :c :d})
