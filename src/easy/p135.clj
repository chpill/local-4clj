;; INFIX CALCULATOR

;; Difficulty: Easy
;; Topics: higher-order-functions math

;; Your friend Joe is always whining about Lisps using the prefix notation for math. Show him how you could easily write a function that does math using the infix notation. Is your favorite language that flexible, Joe?

;; Write a function that accepts a variable length mathematical expression consisting of numbers and the operations +, -, *, and /. Assume a simple calculator that does not do precedence and instead just calculates left to right.

;; Test cases (evaluates to true when your solution is correct):
(= 7  (__ 2 + 5))
(= 42 (__ 38 + 48 - 2 / 2))
(= 8  (__ 10 / 2 - 1 * 2))
(= 72 (__ 20 / 2 + 2 + 4 + 8 - 6 - 10 * 9))
