;; SUM OF SQUARE OF DIGITS

;; Difficulty: Easy
;; Topics: math

;; Write a function which takes a collection of integers as an argument.  Return the count of how many elements are smaller than the sum of their squared component digits.  For example: 10 is larger than 1 squared plus 0 squared; whereas 15 is smaller than 1 squared plus 5 squared.

(def __ ;; Your solution here!

  ,,,)



;; Test cases (evaluates to true when your solution is correct):
(= 8 (__ (range 10)))
(= 19 (__ (range 30)))
(= 50 (__ (range 100)))
(= 50 (__ (range 1000)))
