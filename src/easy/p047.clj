;; CONTAIN YOURSELF

;; Difficulty: Easy

;; The contains? function checks if a KEY is present in a given collection.  This often leads beginner clojurians to use it incorrectly with numerically indexed collections like vectors and lists.

(def __ ;; Your solution here!
  
  ,,,)



;; Test cases (evaluates to true when your solution is correct):
(contains? #{4 5 6} __)
(contains? [1 1 1 1 1] __)
(contains? {4 :a 2 :b} __)
(not (contains? [1 2 4] __))
