;; INTRO TO SEQUENCES

;; Difficulty: Elementary

;; All Clojure collections support sequencing.  You can operate on sequences with functions like first, second, and last.

(def __ ;; Your solution here!
  
  ,,,)



;; Test cases (evaluates to true when your solution is correct):
(= __ (first '(3 2 1)))
(= __ (second [2 3 4]))
(= __ (last (list 1 2 3)))
