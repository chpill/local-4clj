;; INTRO TO MAPS

;; Difficulty: Elementary

;; Maps store key-value pairs.  Both maps and keywords can be used as lookup functions. Commas can be used to make maps more readable, but they are not required.

(def __
  ,,,
  ;; Your code here!
  ,,,)

;; Test cases:
(= __ ((hash-map :a 10, :b 20, :c 30) :b))
(= __ (:b {:a 10, :b 20, :c 30}))
