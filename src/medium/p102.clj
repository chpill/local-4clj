;; INTOCAMELCASE

;; Difficulty: Medium
;; Topics: strings

;; When working with java, you often need to create an object with ;; fieldsLikeThis;; , but you'd rather work with a hashmap that has ;; :keys-like-this;;  until it's time to convert. Write a function which takes lower-case hyphen-separated strings and converts them to camel-case strings.

(def __ ;; Your solution here!

  ,,,)



;; Test cases (evaluates to true when your solution is correct):
(= (__ "something") "something")
(= (__ "multi-word-key") "multiWordKey")
(= (__ "leaveMeAlone") "leaveMeAlone")
