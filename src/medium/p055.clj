;; COUNT OCCURRENCES

;; Difficulty: Medium
;; Topics: seqs core-functions

;; Special restrictions:
;; frequencies

;; Write a function which returns a map containing the number of occurences of each distinct item in a sequence.

(def __ ;; Your solution here!

  ,,,)



;; Test cases (evaluates to true when your solution is correct):
(= (__ [1 1 2 3 2 1 1]) {1 4, 2 2, 3 1})
(= (__ [:b :a :b :a :b]) {:a 2, :b 3})
(= (__ '([1 2] [1 3] [1 3])) {[1 2] 1, [1 3] 2})
