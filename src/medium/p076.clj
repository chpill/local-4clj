;; INTRO TO TRAMPOLINE

;; Difficulty: Medium
;; Topics: recursion

;; The trampoline function takes a function f and a variable number of parameters.  Trampoline calls f with any parameters that were supplied.  If f returns a function, trampoline calls that function with no arguments.  This is repeated, until the return value is not a function, and then trampoline returns that non-function value.  This is useful for implementing mutually recursive algorithms in a way that won't consume the stack.

(def __ ;; Your solution here!
  
  ,,,)



;; Test cases (evaluates to true when your solution is correct):
(= __
   (letfn
     [(foo [x y] #(bar (conj x y) y))
      (bar [x y] (if (> (last x) 10)
                   x
                   #(foo x (+ 2 y))))]
     (trampoline foo [] 1)))
