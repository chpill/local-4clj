;; HAPPY NUMBERS

;; Difficulty: Medium
;; Topics: math

;; Happy numbers are positive integers that follow a particular formula: take each individual digit, square it, and then sum the squares to get a new number. Repeat with the new number and eventually, you might get to a number whose squared sum is 1. This is a happy number. An unhappy number (or sad number) is one that loops endlessly. Write a function that determines if a number is happy or not.
