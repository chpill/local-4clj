# local-4clj

Problems of the famous [4clojure](http://4clojure.com) site.

It is recommended that you create an account there, and do the problems in the
order suggested.

This project provide the same problems, but with an embedded
editor [nightlight](https://sekao.net/nightlight/). It provides you with a repl
(to use it, toggle `instaREPL` in the interface).

You'll know you've solved the problem when all the test-cases evaluates to `true`.
You should then copy-paste your solution on [4clojure](http://4clojure.com), as
it will allow you to study the solutions of other users (the whole point,
really).
